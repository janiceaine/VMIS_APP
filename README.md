# Vehicle Management Information System (VMIS)

*My journey from JavaScript to full-stack development with C# and ASP.NET*

## What This Project Taught Me

Building VMIS has been an incredible learning experience that took me deep into the world of modern web development. What started as a simple idea to track vehicle maintenance turned into a comprehensive journey through C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, and Docker orchestration.

### The Learning Curve
Coming from a JavaScript background, diving into C# was both challenging and rewarding. The strongly-typed nature of C# forced me to think differently about data structures and API design. Working with Entity Framework taught me how ORMs can simplify database interactions while still giving you the power to write custom SQL when needed.

ASP.NET Core's dependency injection and middleware pipeline initially seemed complex, but once I grasped these concepts, building scalable APIs became much more intuitive. The authentication system using JWT tokens was particularly enlightening - understanding how to secure endpoints properly is crucial for any real-world application.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need
- Curiosity to explore the codebase

### Quick Setup


Then visit:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (the sleek UI I built with vanilla JS)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001 (my ASP.NET Core masterpiece)
- **Database**: localhost:1434 (SQL Server doing the heavy lifting)

*Note: I learned the hard way that port conflicts are real - hence the non-standard ports!*

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Frontend (Port 3001)
This started as a simple HTML page but evolved into a responsive single-page application. I deliberately chose vanilla JavaScript over frameworks to really understand the fundamentals. The challenge of managing state without React or Vue taught me so much about DOM manipulation and event handling.

The CSS animations and responsive design were particularly fun to implement - there's something satisfying about crafting smooth transitions without external libraries.

### Backend (Port 5001)
Here's where my C# journey really took off. The ASP.NET Core Web API handles:
- **Vehicle Management**: CRUD operations with proper validation
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Complex relationships between vehicles and service records
- **Data Persistence**: Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security (still learning the nuances here!)

The controller pattern in ASP.NET initially felt verbose compared to Express.js, but I've grown to appreciate the explicit nature and built-in model binding.

### Database (Port 1434)
SQL Server was completely new territory for me. Coming from MongoDB, the relational model required a mindset shift. Learning about foreign keys, indexes, and proper normalization has been invaluable. The initialization scripts that automatically set up the schema were a game-changer for development workflow.

## Development Commands I Use Daily

These are the Docker commands that have become second nature during development:

```bash
# Start everything and watch the magic happen
docker-compose up --build

# Run in background when I need my terminal back
docker-compose up -d

# Check what's actually running (debugging is half the job!)
docker-compose ps

# Tail logs when something's not working (happens more than I'd like to admit)
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Nuclear option - start fresh when everything's broken
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate

# Clean slate including database (be careful with this one!)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Development Workflow

During active development, I usually run services separately to speed up iteration:

```bash
# Backend development (my C# playground)
docker-compose up sqlserver backend

# Frontend tweaking (CSS animations never look right the first time)
docker-compose up frontend

# Database exploration
docker exec -it vmis-sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'Com3onnow!'
```

## Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)

### Port Conflicts
My Mac was already running services on the standard ports, so I had to shift everything. This taught me the importance of checking what's already running with `lsof -i :port`.

### Database Initialization
SQL Server takes time to fully start up, especially on the first run. I learned to be patient and check the health status before panicking about connection errors.

### Docker Layer Caching
Understanding how Docker builds and caches layers made rebuilds much faster. Now I structure my Dockerfiles to maximize cache hits.

### CORS Issues
The classic web developer rite of passage! Configuring CORS properly between frontend and backend was trickier than expected, but essential for local development.

## Environment Configuration

The docker-compose.yml handles these automatically, but understanding what they do helped me debug issues:

```yaml
# SQL Server setup
MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD: 'Com3onnow!'  # Not production-ready, obviously!
ACCEPT_EULA: 'Y'

# ASP.NET Core configuration
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production  # Keeps things realistic
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection: Data Source=sqlserver,1433;Initial Catalog=VMIS;User ID=sa;Password=Com3onnow!;TrustServerCertificate=True
```

## Data Persistence & Cleanup

One thing I love about this setup is how cleanly it handles data:

```bash
# Reset everything but keep the images
docker-compose down -v

# Really start fresh (warning: this removes the Docker volume)
docker volume rm vmis_sqlserver_data

# Check what volumes exist
docker volume ls
```

The `vmis_sqlserver_data` volume means your test data survives container restarts - super helpful during development!

## Reflection & Next Steps

Building VMIS has been more than just a coding project - it's been a masterclass in full-stack development. The transition from JavaScript to C# challenged me to think more structurally about application architecture. Every bug I encountered taught me something new about debugging across different layers of the stack.

### What I'm Proud Of
- **Clean Architecture**: The separation between controllers, services, and data layers feels right
- **Docker Integration**: Everything runs consistently across different environments
- **Database Design**: Proper relationships and constraints that actually make sense
- **Frontend Polish**: Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

### What I'd Improve Next Time
- **Testing**: I focused so much on getting features working that I didn't write enough unit tests
- **Error Handling**: More graceful error responses and user feedback
- **Security**: Implement proper role-based authorization
- **Performance**: Add caching and optimize database queries

### Technologies That Clicked
- **Entity Framework Core**: Once I understood the conventions, it felt magical
- **ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection**: Made testing and modularity so much cleaner
- **Docker Compose**: Local development has never been easier
- **SQL Server**: The tooling and management capabilities are impressive

## Deployment Guide

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

The frontend is configured to automatically deploy to Netlify from this GitHub repository:

1. **Push to GitHub** (see instructions below)
2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "New site from Git" 
   - Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Deploy settings:
     - Build command: `echo 'Static frontend - no build needed'`
     - Publish directory: `Frontend`

3. **Update Backend URL**:
   - After deploying your backend (see below), update `Frontend/config.js`
   - Change the production `API_BASE_URL` to your backend URL
   - Commit and push - Netlify will auto-redeploy

### Backend Deployment (Heroku/Railway/Azure)

For the ASP.NET Core backend, I recommend these platforms:

**Option 1: Heroku** (Free tier available)
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
brew install heroku/brew/heroku

# Login and create app
heroku login
heroku create your-vmis-backend

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production -a your-vmis-backend

# Deploy
git subtree push --prefix=Backend heroku main
```

**Option 2: Railway** (Easy deployment)
- Connect your GitHub repo at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Select the Backend folder
- Railway auto-detects .NET and deploys

**Option 3: Azure App Service** (Microsoft's platform)
- Perfect fit for ASP.NET Core
- Integrates well with Azure SQL Database
- Use Visual Studio or Azure CLI for deployment

### Database Options

**For Production:**
- **Azure SQL Database** (scales well, managed)
- **AWS RDS SQL Server** (reliable, AWS ecosystem)
- **Railway PostgreSQL** (if you modify to use PostgreSQL)

**For Development/Demo:**
- Keep using Docker with SQL Server
- Railway provides free PostgreSQL databases

### GitHub Setup

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack VMIS application

- ASP.NET Core backend with Entity Framework
- Vanilla JavaScript frontend with responsive design  
- Docker Compose development environment
- Ready for deployment to Netlify + Heroku/Railway"

# Create repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vmis-vehicle-management.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

This project transformed my understanding of how modern web applications are built. The C# ecosystem's emphasis on conventions and strong typing has made me a more disciplined developer. I'm excited to take these skills to the next level!
